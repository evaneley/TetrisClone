\section{Building} \begin{itemize}
    
    \item To play the game, we are going to include a .zip file that 
will contain the necessary files and an executable file that runs the 
program. This is a simpler solution to play the game rather than 
compiling the program on your own system.
    \item To play, simply unzip the contents of the zip file that is 
within the master branch from the repository, and run the "Tetris" 
executable that is present within the unzipped folder. This will launch 
the game.
